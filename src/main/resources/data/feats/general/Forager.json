{"featName":"Forager","level":1,"traits":"General, Skill","prerequisites":"trained in Survival","description":"Forager Feat 1\r\nGeneralSkill\r\nSource Core Rulebook pg. 261\r\nPrerequisites trained in Survival\r\nWhile using Survival to Subsist, if you roll any result worse than a success, you get a success. On a success, you can provide subsistence living for yourself and four additional creatures, and on a critical success, you can take care of twice as many creatures as on a success.\r\n\r\n Each time your proficiency rank in Survival increases, double the number of additional creatures you can take care of on a success (to eight if you’re an expert, 16 if you’re a master, or 32 if you’re legendary). You can choose to care for half the number of additional creatures and provide a comfortable living instead of subsistence living.\r\n\r\n Multiple smaller creatures or creatures with significantly smaller appetites than a human are counted as a single creature for this feat, and larger creatures or those with significantly greater appetites each count as multiple creatures. The GM determines how much a non-human creature needs to eat."}
