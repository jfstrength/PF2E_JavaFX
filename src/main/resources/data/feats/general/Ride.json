{"featName":"Ride","level":1,"traits":"General","prerequisites":"—","description":"Ride Feat 1\r\nGeneral\r\nSource Core Rulebook pg. 266\r\nWhen you Command an Animal you’re mounted on to take a move action (such as Stride), you automatically succeed instead of needing to attempt a check. Any animal you’re mounted on acts on your turn, like a minion. If you Mount an animal in the middle of an encounter, it skips its next turn and then acts on your next turn. Page 249 has more on Command an Animal."}
