Select one of the specialties listed on page 267; you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Crafting checks to Craft items of that type. If you are a master in Crafting, this bonus increases to +2. If itâ€™s unclear whether the specialty applies, the GM decides. Some specialties might apply only partially. For example, if you were making a morningstar and had specialty in woodworking, the GM might give you half your bonus because the item requires both blacksmithing and woodworking.\r\nSpecialty Crafting\r\nSpecialty\tApplicable Items\r\nAlchemy*\tAlchemical items such as elixirs\r\nArtistry\tFine art, including jewelry\r\nBlacksmithing\tDurable metal goods, including metal armor\r\nBookmaking\tBooks and paper\r\nGlassmaking\tGlass, including glassware and windows\r\nLeatherworking\tLeather goods, including leather armor\r\nPottery\tCeramic goods\r\nShipbuilding\tShips and boats\r\nStonemasonry\tStone goods and structures\r\nTailoring\tClothing\r\nWeaving\tTextiles, baskets, and rugs\r\nWoodworking\tWooden goods and structures\r\n\r\n * You must have the Alchemical Crafting skill feat to Craft alchemical items."}
